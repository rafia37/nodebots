One for the AGENDA below, one for each in the agenda

AGENDA
======

* Intro - backgrounds, how we got stared building nodebots, international nodebots day
* What we are building - picture of the nodebot
* What is a nodebot?
* Wait! What is node? (javascript on the server . . . or controlling a robot in this case)
* What is?  -- The slide from below
* Teams (wish we had enough for everyone but find teams of 4)
* Rules
  * have fun!
  * make sure everyone can participate (if you know electronics, step aside and let someone else try!)
  * someone from the team has to be here for the battle from 4pm to 5pm
* Prizes
  * Winner of the sumobot battle that is happening today at 4:15 (be there at 4!) in the big room
  * Best use of the LEDs  

==============================

* The parts - one slide for each of these with a picture (maybe I take over here?)
  * Batteries and battery holder
  * Motor controller
  * Tiny Tile - Intel Curie programmable with a Arduino IDE (picture of tile and IDE)
  * Chassis (platform, motors and wheels)
  * Pagenodes (this is where the magic happens)
  * LEDs


* TODO
  * build the chassis
  * connect the batteries to the motor controller and the motor controller to the Tiny Tile
  * figure out what to do with LEDs and connect them
  * do the pagenodes work!
  * plug in the Game Pad
  * control your robot
  * decorate and customize with popcycle sticks and glue (and glitter just because Embrie wanted it)!

* IDEAS
  * the controls are horrible and too fast! make them better
  * a strip of one color of LED's in boring! Make it beautiful

* Insider stuff
  * sometimes the bluetooth won't show up . . . jump start it with power though USB
  * the motors are rated at 4.5 volts . . . we are sending 9! So be careful


What is?
=============
  * Wait! What is Javascript?
  * Wait! What is Jonny Five?
  * Wait! What is a programming language?
  * Wait! What is machine code?
  * Wait! What is assembly?
  * Wait! What is a processor?
  * Wait! What is a transistor?
  * Wait! What is a PN junction?
  * Wait! Why silicon?
  All good questions . . . . but you don't need to know answers to any of them!
